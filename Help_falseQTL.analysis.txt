DESCRIPTION
This script is just a wrapper for the affyGG package by Ritsert Jansen, meant to make the analysis more convenient for working with eQTLs generated using RI panels of mice such as the LXS and BXD. 

ARGUMENTS
probeset
ID of eQTL probeset to be analyzed.

geno.file
File with genotype data (.csv only). Row names are marker ID's, column1=chr, column2=Mb, and remaining columns contain genotypes for individual strains. 

cel.dir
Directory in which the CEL files are found.

strain
Character, "lxs" or "bxd", used to identify which columns from genotype file contain strain alleles. 

batch
(optional) vector with batch numbers in which each individual (e.g. BXD) was processed. Default is NULL. This is passed to affyGG probeElimination function.

cis.buffer
Numeric, allows user to specify the Mb range that defines a cis QTL. It will then look for the peak linkage markers within that range of the gene for creating the probe plot and executing the probe elimination analysis.

label
Optional character object added to results folder and other output. 

DETAILS
The specific Affymetrix GeneChip type is determined by the script and used to load the proper probe sequence and probeset annotation data. Currently only Mouse 430 2.0 and Mouse 430A 2.0 chips are supported. 

Strain ID's are scraped from the genotype data file column names and compared with CEL file names in order to match each CEL to its matching genotype data. Therefore, it is important to ensure that strain ID's are formatted the same in both places. Strains will be mistakenly excluded from analysis if, for example, a strain in labeled as BXD01 in the genotype data and BXD1 in the cel file name. 

Note that it is not necessary to remove extraneous information from a CEL file name. Using GREP, the script will identify 021597_NB_032498_BXD1_PFC.CEL just as well as BXD1.CEL. The end of a strain ID is determined by seeking the first non-numeric character after the strain number.
